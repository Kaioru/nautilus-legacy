# Nautilus [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Kaioru/nautilus.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/Kaioru/nautilus)
Nautilus is a modular server emulator.

## Features
**Distributed** - Nautilus makes use of Java's RMI API to have a distributed architecture which allows server administrators to easily scale the service depending on the load.

**Flexibility** - Need a 2nd-level cache for your database connections? Or a database connection pool like HikariCP? Just edit the config files, no additional work required!

**Modular** - Use specific parts of Nautilus in your application without the junk you don't need.
